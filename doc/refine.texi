@cindex introduction

This is a copy of refine/README file from the distribution.

Refine is a 3D tetrahedral grid adaptation framework. It is
implemented with an object-oriented flavor in the C language.  Most
functionality is wrapped into Ruby scripting language extensions
@code{http://www.ruby-lang.org/} for use in test first programing and unit
testing. See the README.EXT file in the Ruby distribution for details
on ruby extensions.
 
The refine library can be called by FUN3D @code{http://fun3d.larc.nasa.gov/}
to perform adaptation with a parallel execution scheme.
 
CAD geometry access is facilitated with the NASA Langley Geomerty
Labratory SDK @code{http://geolab.larc.nasa.gov/}, which assess CAD
information with the CAPRI API
@code{http://raphael.mit.edu/capri/docs.html}.

@cindex overview

The refine library is composed of base objects, the grid object, grid
mix-ins, and child objects

Base objects:
@enumerate
@item
adj - element node adjacency
@item
queue - transaction queue for parallel connectivity modifcations.
@item
sort - list sorting and searching routines.
@item
line - stores arrays of nodes (advancing layer growth curves).
@item
near - near tree for finding nearby things
@item
intersect - computes if elements intersect. 
@end enumerate

Grid Object:
@enumerate
@item
grid - stores majority of grid data and low-level methods.
@end enumerate

Grid Mix-ins
@enumerate
@item
gridmath - basic vector and matrix meth routines
@item
gridmetric - computes element metrics (volume, aspect ratio)
@item
gridswap - edge and face swapping routines
@item
gridcad - node projection and node smoothing for improved element quality
@item
gridgeom - parallel GeoSDK/CAPRI restart routines.
@item
gridinsert - inserts and removes nodes into grid.
@item
gridmpi - parallel grid adaptation helper
@item
gridfortran - fortran bindings for linking to FUN3D.
@end enumerate

Grid Mix-ins
@enumerate
@item
gridmove - grid movement by linear elasticity or springs (inherts form grid)
@end enumerate
