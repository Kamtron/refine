open source

time adapt pass elements
profile
make faster, more efficient
don't balloon up in size
insert once, right place

move the uv bounding box test to hihgest level
improve surface smoothing with confidence?
improve smoothing with anisotropy in 45 degree to axis (cube, rotating metric)
make sure all triangles have one tet and tet has one neighbor by
turning on validation.

bl insert

cavity in 2D/3D

include surface curvature constraints in metric

create jenkins test
- make check valgrind
- make check stack fuzz
- UGAWG test cases
  - 3d geom
- add curved cases

run test cases from UGAWG

interp metric on curved surface and parallel
 make debug tecplot status
 interpolate in u,v,s

validate normal deviation (make metric big across cylinder)
-- insert with ball
-- create an embbeded surface as a debug measure,
      create norm/tests for problems

jacobian form of tet quality
- implement refine/one quality measures
- det stability in quality no longer issue

ideal tet using principle direction? but faces dissaggree? optimizer?

smooth
 sort worst to best? edge, surface, volume sequence
 requeue neighbors with large changes? particulary quality drops

parallel geom
 ref_geom load bal
 parallel update ghost geom param
 geom gas restart file IO

refactor ref_geom to remove methods and tests, how is it used, what is needed?

eliminate short edges (cavity)

cavity
- face based grow and shrink
 - shrink needs list delete

- refactor twod migrate
- have graph in migrate
- agree on age
- agree on agglomeration

http://www.cs.sandia.gov/Zoltan/ug_html/ug_alg_phg.html

partition boundary artifacts
 - graph based partitioner
   - provide zoltan callbacks
   - rebuild zoltan?
- graph agglomeration to remove artifacts
   - age
   - parallel agglomeration to protect age

low priority surface reconstruction
- consult white
-- approximate normal as angle weighted,

+ faster background interp (store guess)

+create jenkins test
+ make check
+ UGAWG test cases
  + 2d linear
  + 3d linear

+ clean up driver codes

+ only use single part load balance under certain size 0.5M

+ ref_adapt_test half-square/hs01.b8.ugrid twod memory prob
+ scale metric
+ volume validation should be area in twod
+ coarsen

+ quality of edge primitive
  + measure / define quaility (edge length, mean ratio, metric norm)
    + histogram
  + tune parameters not available in paper or extend edge primitive scheme?

+  smooth face
+    get ideal uv using metric and triangle info
+    average

+  don't collapse remove geom nodes

+ move repo to gitlab
