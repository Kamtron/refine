open source

only use single part load balance under certain size 

create jenkins test
- make check
- make check valgrind
- make check stack fuzz
- UGAWG test cases
  - 2d linear
  - 3d linear
  - 3d geom

jacobian form of tet quality with optimizer
- implement refine/one quality measures
- det stability in quality no longer issue

ideal tet using principle direction? but faces dissaggree?

interp metric in threed and parallel

clean up driver codes

run test cases from UGAWG

validate normal deviation (make metric big across cylinder)
-- insert with ball
-- create an embbeded surface as a debug measure,
      create norm/tests for problems

smooth
 sort worst to best? edge, surface, volume sequence
 requeue neighbors with large changes? particulary quality drops

parallel geom gas restart file IO

parallel
 ref_geom load bal
 parallel update ghost geom param

refactor ref_geom to remove methods and tests, how is it used, what is needed?

eliminate short edges

cavity
- face based grow and shrink
 - shrink needs list delete

- refactor twod migrate
- have graph in migrate
- agree on age
- agree on agglomeration

http://www.cs.sandia.gov/Zoltan/ug_html/ug_alg_phg.html

partition boundary artifacts
 - graph based partitioner
   - provide zoltan callbacks
   - rebuild zoltan?
- graph agglomeration to remove artifacts
   - age
   - parallel agglomeration to protect age


low priority surface reconstruction
- consult white
-- approximate normal as angle weighted,

+ ref_adapt_test half-square/hs01.b8.ugrid twod memory prob
+ scale metric
+ volume validation should be area in twod
+ coarsen

+ quality of edge primitive
  + measure / define quaility (edge length, mean ratio, metric norm)
    + histogram
  + tune parameters not available in paper or extend edge primitive scheme?

+  smooth face
+    get ideal uv using metric and triangle info
+    average

+  don't collapse remove geom nodes
