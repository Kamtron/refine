jacobian form of tet quality with optimizer
- implement refine/one quality measures

ideal tet using principle direction? but faces dissaggree?

interp metric in threed and parallel

clean up driver codes

run test cases from UGAWG

validate normal deviation (make metric big across cylinder)

smooth
 sort worst to best? edge, surface, volume sequence
 requeue neighbors with large changes? particulary quality drops


  eliminate short edges

  don't remove geom nodes

  parallel restart file
  load bal
  parallel update ghost geom param

  refactor remove methods and tests, how is it used, what is needed?

*/


cavity
- face based grow and shrink
 - shrink needs list delete

- det stability in quality

- refactor twod migrate
- have graph in migrate
- agree on age
- agree on agglomeration

partition boundary artifacts
 - graph based partitioner
   - provide zoltan callbacks
   - rebuild zoltan?
 - agglomeration
   - age
   - parallel agglomeration to protect age

surface projection
 - surface reconstruction
   - consult white
 - linear elasticity
 -- insert with ball
 -- approximate normal as angle weighted, 
     Ref/borouchaki-villard-laug-george-cmame-2005-surface-reconstruction.pdf
 -- create an embbeded surface as a debug measure,
      create norm/tests for problems

- metric conformity and or ellipse...
- graph agglom to remove artifacts


+ ref_adapt_test half-square/hs01.b8.ugrid twod memory prob
+ scale metric
+ volume validation should be area in twod
+ coarsen

+ quality of edge primitive
  + measure / define quaility (edge length, mean ratio, metric norm)
    + histogram
  + tune parameters not available in paper or extend edge primitive scheme?

+  smooth face
+    get ideal uv using metric and triangle info
+    average
