* why is prism uniformly refining when bl boundary corsening
  ( plot edges ratios? )
* how to stop vertual hanging nodes, why is quality passing?
* best pract?
* parallel exchange m with x in subdiv newnode

adapt
  split based on metric (unit tested of course)


tet adaptation.
  statistics
    validation tet volume
    plot edge lengths
    what changed?
      start an age to use later in partitioning...
      plot each change?
  convergence
    stopping
    tolerence
  metric
    implied mixed metric
    limit change in metric
    smoothing
  partition poor quality cells to the interior with aging

projection (fake geom)
  per-olaf linear elasticity

fun3d
  solve bp
  adjoint bp validation
  cgns mixed -> tecplot bug reported
  error estimation for mixed
  export res from adjoint
  call two from fun

clean up
  separate global from node add and remove

chunk sizes should not be bigger than total nubmer of items (if known)

speedup

avoid heap sort
- replace one at the top of part_cell with comp row storage

ideas

only have a cell exist once, no duplicate cells?
