**SomeFutureDate**: Released Refine **NextRelase**

Works with FUN3D Version(s): **SomeFUN3DVersion**

Mon Oct 18, 2004: Released Refine 1.2.3

** internal release **
Added a texinfo refine manual, refine/doc/refine.texi.
Added extra check on collapse edge to prevent invalid connectivities.
Added CAPRI2 compatibility to current CAPRI (CADGeom) routines (run
./configure with --enable_CAPRI2 to activate).  Imposed limits on the
minimum element quality allowed after a edge split or collapse.  Added
functionality to untangle surfaces triangles in UV space.  Correctly
handle adaptation on geometry that has been transformed in the
SDK. Various FORTRAN API changes that require a compatible version
of FUN3D. 

Started on research into edge-based operator adaptation. Cost function
for grid improvement is selectable with gridSetCostFunction.

Wed Aug 17, 2004: Released Refine 1.2.2

Fixed FAKEGeom.

Wed Aug 17, 2004: Released Refine 1.2.1

Removed all references to SDK UG_API and Goolache from the refine lib;
you will only need to link to GEOLAB SDK CADGeom and MeatLib.  Added
static versions of SGI n32 CADGeom+CAPRINative and MeatLib in
geomSGIn32; see INSTALL for usage. Silenced reporting of CAD parameter
mismatches on restart. Note that there is a bug in the recreation of
CAPRI restarts that still needs to be fixed, but projecting points
works for all geometries tested so far.  Limited the range of R
(aspect ratio) to reduce the number of cases that the linear elasticity
system goes unstable with Gauss-Seidel. Use springs if the linear
elasticity system goes unstable. I have noticed an extra node or cell
reported by the load balancing routine in FUN3D on rare occasions for
large grids on may processors. I have not been able to isolate
problem.

Wed Aug  9, 2004: Released Refine 1.2.0

Replaced obsolete SDK/Goolache/MeshMgr with SDK/UG_API methods.  The
combination of removing cells from the mesh with two boundary triangles
(gridRemoveTwoFaceCell), Simplex optimization of volume
(gridRelaxNegativeCells), and existing edge swapping has been able to
fix the few negative elements that result from linear elasticity grid
movement to perform surface projection.

Wed Jul 16, 2004: Released Refine 1.1.0

Added linear elasticity grid movement
SDK tagged DynLoader_MeshMgr_Used

Wed Jul 13, 2004: Released Refine 1.0.0

First public release. Use with FUN3D version 3.3.0

Wed Jun 29, 2004: Released Refine 0.7.5

Tag before going to new GeoSDK UG_API implementation.
Continued work on parallel rebuild of GeoSDK restart info.

Wed Jun  2, 2004: Released Refine 0.7.4

gridmove and CAPRI(CADGeom) read work in parallel. Parallel node
smoothing works for CAD and fake geometry. Fixed off-by-one numbering
bug in FORTRAN interface gridfreezenode.

Mon May  3, 2004: Released Refine 0.7.3

Tagging before gridmpi:gridParallelEdgeCollapse extension.

Thu Apr 20, 2004: Released Refine 0.7.2

Tagging before queue refactor and gridmpi:gridApplayQueue speedup.

Thu Apr 15, 2004: Released Refine 0.7.1

Last version to use old pre-GeoBool tag on the SDK. Fixed more bugs in
multiple normals for BWB case.

Thu Apr 11, 2004: Released Refine 0.7.0

refine now has parallel FORTRAN bindings for FUN3D(HEFSS) see
HEFSS.rps/LibF90/refine_interface.f90 and refine/src/gridfortran.c.
Added collision detection, variable normals, and multiple normals to
advancing fronts. Harold Atkins added code to generate an Synthetic
Jet Grid. Multiple normals (blends) are more general.

Thu Jan 30, 2003: Released Refine 0.6

MesherX makes viscous grids on a box, plate, and om6

Thu Jan 15, 2003: Released Refine 0.5

New MesherX library structure

Thu Jan  9, 2003: Released Refine 0.4

Now have advancing layers with inflation and can insert non-manifold
edges on faces
