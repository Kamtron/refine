egads recon
 clean up method
 examine the t values to ensure it is monotonic
 switch to EG_invEvaluateGuess
   why not working for edges (initialized to right node t?)
   revert on failure (wrap?)
   for faces start from interior?
   or walk edges?

reuse faceid around in ref_collapse_edge_geometry

accept comm as argument
create REF_MPI to eliminate static, store comm, and store time

store metric in log form

extract cell orient from tri_node_angle and correct _dnode0 uses in code

collapse
 examine triangle MR

smarter adapt parameters
 prevent slivers by setting collapse limits
 tighten limits near convergence

cavity operator in 2D/3D
 eliminate short edges (cavity)
 sliver deletion

layer insert
 cavity recover triangle side
 cavity recover tet face

insert optimized node location (uv,xyz) with validity constraint

ideal tri/tet use log avg m?

quadratic programming optimize min element quality

histogram history plots

ellipsoid viz 

docs?
provide dense api (or pack)
provide 2D api

EGADS questions:
- degnerate edges (faces)
  EG_getTopology (mtype edge)
- surface normal (direction and inside/outside orientation)
  EG_getTopology (mtype sforward is UxV out of domain)
- easiest way to build the planar delta wing
  - draw 2D planform, extrude, trim with booleans
- for initial grids, set .tParams, vtess to visualize

time adapt pass elements
profile
make faster, more efficient
don't balloon up in size
insert once, right place

make sure all triangles have one tet and tet has one neighbor by
turning on validation.

create jenkins test
- make check stack fuzz

interp metric on curved surface
 make debug tecplot status
 interpolate in u,v,s

refactor ref_export to extract compact_n2o twod and cell
with ref_grid_boundary_nodes

validate normal deviation (make metric big across cylinder)
-- insert with ball
-- create an embbeded surface as a debug measure,
      create norm/tests for problems

ideal tet using principle direction? but faces dissaggree? optimizer?

smooth
 sort worst to best? edge, surface, volume sequence
 requeue neighbors with large changes? particulary quality drops
 freitag smoothing
 surface smoothing without geom

refactor ref_geom to remove methods and tests, how is it used, what is needed?

- refactor twod migrate
- have graph in migrate
- agree on age
- agree on agglomeration

http://www.cs.sandia.gov/Zoltan/ug_html/ug_alg_phg.html

partition boundary artifacts
 - graph based partitioner
   - provide zoltan callbacks
   - rebuild zoltan?
- graph agglomeration to remove artifacts
   - age
   - parallel agglomeration to protect age

low priority surface reconstruction when EGADS not available
- consult white
