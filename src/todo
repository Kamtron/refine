boundary tangle in cone-cone and om6

extract cell orient from tri_node_angle and correct _dnode0 uses in code

layer insert
 cavity recover triangle side
 cavity recover tet face

cavity operator in 2D/3D
 sliver deletion
 eliminate short edges (cavity)

egads recon
 clean up method
 edge candidates must have more than one tri type
 switch to EG_invEvaluateGuess

extract faceids from ref_collapse_edge_geometry

ideal tri/tet use log avg m?

histogram hist plots

ellipsoid viz 

docs?
provide dense api (or pack)
provide 2D api

EGADS questions:
- degnerate edges (faces)
  EG_getTopology (mtype edge)
- surface normal (direction and inside/outside orientation)
  EG_getTopology (mtype sforward is UxV out of domain)
- easiest way to build the planar delta wing
  - draw 2D planform, extrude, trim with booleans
- for initial grids, set .tParams, vtess to visualize

open source

time adapt pass elements
profile
make faster, more efficient
don't balloon up in size
insert once, right place

make sure all triangles have one tet and tet has one neighbor by
turning on validation.

create jenkins test
- make check stack fuzz

interp metric parallel

interp metric on curved surface
 make debug tecplot status
 interpolate in u,v,s

refactor ref_export to extract compact_n2o twod and cell
with ref_grid_boundary_nodes

validate normal deviation (make metric big across cylinder)
-- insert with ball
-- create an embbeded surface as a debug measure,
      create norm/tests for problems

ideal tet using principle direction? but faces dissaggree? optimizer?

smooth
 sort worst to best? edge, surface, volume sequence
 requeue neighbors with large changes? particulary quality drops
 freitag smoothing
 surface smoothing without geom

refactor ref_geom to remove methods and tests, how is it used, what is needed?

- refactor twod migrate
- have graph in migrate
- agree on age
- agree on agglomeration

partition boundary artifacts
 - graph based partitioner
   - provide zoltan callbacks
   - rebuild zoltan?
- graph agglomeration to remove artifacts
   - age
   - parallel agglomeration to protect age
