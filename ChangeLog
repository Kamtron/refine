	* /src/layer.c (layerBlend) multiple normals are handled with
	blend elements. The number of normals is increased with
	layerSplitBlend. Blends are not entirely general yet.

	* /src/layer.c (layerExtrudeBlend) wakes are created by extruding
	blend elements

	* MesherX can rebuild edges, faces, and volume with 
	SDK/Goolache/MeshMgr to make valid viscous grid.
	* Made 0.6 Release.

	* /src/layer.c (layerAdvance): fixed bug for multiple constrained
	edges and incorrect constrained faces. Refactored for clarity.
