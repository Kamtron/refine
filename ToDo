List of stuff to work on for refine/MesherX (bug fixes, improvements, etc.)

-refine

Start Builds!!!!!

--Major refactoring

add nodes and comments to tecplot neg cells

unit test CADGeom_ReversedSurfaceNormal

Check and see if I should only queue a cell for removal if it has a
ghost node. faces and edges are that way.

verify that I am geeting all the performance out the the volume
smoothing that is possible.

move gridMinFaceAreaUV gridFaceAreaUV from grdcad to gridmetric

make consistant use of the cost constraint functions.

maintain linear data for split and collapse. 
(this includes edge and face parameter values)

EdgeSplitAt -> edgeSplitRatio
Replace projections with evaluations.

Validate a mesh by spliting and projecting offending faces (via Bob)

Exact Edge smoothing with invalid backoff

get edge metric working for node smoothing

modify face mr when edge based cost switch?
should there be a mr test in swap?

Finish face swap parallelization. there are only 5 nodes so that means
32 posiblities. (unit testing could be less if ring, top&bottom are
treated seperately)

try new metrics/constrints
- Add a face area in UV constraint to cost to fight clifs.
- Smooth face in mapped UV space instead of physical space

Parameter values: verify at start and then always evaluate to avoid
projections.

think about geom edge collapse on a beth grid with no geom edges
Make a matrix of collapse possilbities for node 0,1 on bound or not

rename grid AR to cost

gridcad : get rid of 
-gridOptimizeFaceUV
-gridSmoothFaceMR
-gridOptimizeUVForVolume

gridmetric : get rid of
-gridCellRatioErrorDerivative

clean up gridSplitEdgeIfNear gridSplitFaceAt gridSplitCellAt
gridInsertInToGeomEdge gridInsertInToGeomFace gridInsertInToVolume

--Edge Based

parallelize the edge queue

--Parallel adapt

corsening on partition boundaries 
continue speed testing

-MesherX

improved normal visiblity on symm planes.
check for potential collisions of blend normals with surrounding area
check out frozen normal direction smoothing (VGrid style)
