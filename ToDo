List of stuff to work on for refine/MesherX (bug fixes, improvements, etc.)

-refine

--Major refactoring

research mapped edge length and fix edge ratio length routines

maintain linear data for split and collapse.

Validate a mesh by spliting and projecting offending faces (via Bob)

Exact Edge smoothing with invalid backoff

get edge metric working for node smoothing

modify face mr when edge based cost switch

Finish face swap parallelization. there are only 5 nodes so that means
32 posiblities. (unit testing could be less if ring, top&bottom are
treated seperately)

Use LQP for face optimizization.

try new metrics/constrints
- Add a face area in UV constraint to cost to fight clifs.
- Smooth face in mapped UV space instead of physical space

Parameter values: verify at start and then always evaluate to avoid
projections.

think about geom edge collapse on a beth grid with no geom edges
Make a matrix of collapse possilbities for node 0,1 on bound or not

rename grid AR to cost

gridcad : get rid of 
-gridOptimizeFaceUV
-gridSmoothFaceMR
-gridOptimizeUVForVolume

gridmetric : get rid of
-gridCellRatioErrorDerivative

clean up gridSplitEdgeIfNear gridSplitFaceAt gridSplitCellAt
gridInsertInToGeomEdge gridInsertInToGeomFace gridInsertInToVolume

--Edge Based

parallelize the edge queue

--Parallel adapt

corsening on partition boundaries 
continue speed testing

-MesherX

improved normal visiblity on symm planes.
check for potential collisions of blend normals with surrounding area
check out frozen normal direction smoothing (VGrid style)
