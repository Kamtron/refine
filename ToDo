List of stuff to work on for refine/MesherX (bug fixes, improvements, etc.)

--Major refactoring

- mixed element

- load balancing on the fly

- printf error when face is empty for edge split with !gridContinuousEquator
- think about geom edge collapse on fauxgeom with no geom edges
  Make a matrix of collapse possilbities for node 0,1 on bound or not
- Add a new method to return whether a geometry face has an underlying
  geometric (CAD) definition. (for fauxgeom)

- Do all operations in quality order via plan
gridmetric : get rid of
-gridLargestRatioEdge
-gridSmallestRatioEdge

- refactor grid move to galerkin?
- Refactor conn stuff in grid move and grid to unify

- verify that I am getting all the performance (mesh quality) out the
  the volume smoothing that is possible.  make consistant use of the
  cost constraint functions.

- Exact Edge smoothing with invalid backoff

- make the min allowed face area (and volume) a grid struct var.

- get edge metric working for node smoothing

- log euclidean metrics

- Finish face swap parallelization. there are only 5 nodes so that means
  32 posiblities. (unit testing could be less if ring, top&bottom are
  treated seperately)

- rename grid AR to cost

clean up parallel adapt!

gridAttach* gridDetach* stuff

- unitfy cell face arrays and method

--Parallel adapt

coarsening on partition boundaries 
continue speed testing

only interior + load balancing

-MesherX

improved normal visiblity on symm planes.
check for potential collisions of blend normals with surrounding area
check out frozen normal direction smoothing (VGrid style)

-Start Over?

- Write in ruby + ruby inline
- C with swig, ruby inline,  or equivalent
- better mock of CAD object
- better logging/exceptions
- better face/cell naming/metaphor
- pair...
