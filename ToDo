List of stuff to work on for refine/MesherX (bug fixes, improvements, etc.)

-refine

--Major refactoring

research mapped edge length and fix edge ratio length routines

fix gridCollapseEdgeToBestConfiguration gridCollapseCost logic

Return NULL from edge swap if gap0 and gap1 or n1 or n0 are ghost,
because the ghost faces will not be installed on local processor so
that a validity check can take place.

Finish face swap parallelization. there are only 5 nodes so that means
23 posiblities. (unit testing could be less if ring, top&bottom are
treated seperatedly)

Added a face area in UV constraint to cost.

Smooth face in mapped UV space instead of physical space

Parameter values: verify at start and then always evaluate to avoid
projections.

think about geom edge collapse on a beth grid with no geom edges
Make a matrix of collapse possilbities for node 0,1 on bound or not

rename grid AR to cost

gridcad : get rid of 
-gridOptimizeFaceUV
-gridSmoothFaceMR
-gridOptimizeUVForVolume

gridmetric : get rid of
-gridCellRatioErrorDerivative

clean up gridSplitEdgeIfNear gridSplitFaceAt gridSplitCellAt
gridInsertInToGeomEdge gridInsertInToGeomFace gridInsertInToVolume

--Edge Based

parallelize the edge queue

--Parallel adapt

corsening on partition boundaries 
continue speed testing

-MesherX

improved normal visiblity on symm planes.
check for potential collisions of blend normals with surrounding area
check out frozen normal direction smoothing (VGrid style)
