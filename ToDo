List of stuff to work on for refine/MesherX (bug fixes, improvements, etc.)

-refine

Start Builds!!!!!

--Major refactoring

Are global cell indexes really needed or can they be computed after
adaptation?

refactor to use the plan object in the edge based list

Use the plan object to speed up node smooth of ghost boundary in
parallel.


EdgeSplitAt -> edgeSplitRatio
Replace projections with evaluations.

Make sure that nodes are in final position in xyx, uv, and t before
queuing so that off-processors recieve cosistant data.

when splitting or collasping on geomedge update face uv from edgeT

maintain linear data for split and collapse. this includes edge and
face parameter values. This will be easier to do with edgeSplitRatio


Validate a mesh by spliting offending faces into three and evaluating
(via Bob)


verify that I am getting all the performance (mesh quality) out the
the volume smoothing that is possible.  make consistant use of the
cost constraint functions.


Exact Edge smoothing with invalid backoff


get edge metric working for node smoothing


Finish face swap parallelization. there are only 5 nodes so that means
32 posiblities. (unit testing could be less if ring, top&bottom are
treated seperately)


Parameter values: verify at start and then always evaluate to avoid
projections.


rename grid AR to cost

gridcad : get rid of 
-gridOptimizeFaceUV
-gridSmoothFaceMR
-gridOptimizeUVForVolume

gridmetric : get rid of
-gridCellRatioErrorDerivative

clean up gridSplitEdgeIfNear gridSplitFaceAt gridSplitCellAt
gridInsertInToGeomEdge gridInsertInToGeomFace gridInsertInToVolume


think about geom edge collapse on a beth grid with no geom edges
Make a matrix of collapse possilbities for node 0,1 on bound or not

Add a new method to return whether a geometry face has an underlying
geometric (CAD) definition.

--Edge Based

parallelize the edge queue

--Parallel adapt

corsening on partition boundaries 
continue speed testing

-MesherX

improved normal visiblity on symm planes.
check for potential collisions of blend normals with surrounding area
check out frozen normal direction smoothing (VGrid style)
