List of stuff to work on for refine/MesherX (bug fixes, improvements, etc.)

-refine

--Major refactoring

Parameter values: verify at start and then always evaluate to avoid
projections.

merge edge based research into mainline code

add a contriant option to grid ar(cost)
 make it && primatives

fix edge ratio length routines

gridcad : get rid of 
-gridSafeProjectNode
-gridRobustProjectNode
-gridOptimizeFaceUV
-gridSmoothFaceMR
-gridOptimizeUVForVolume

gridmetric : get rid of
-gridCellRatioErrorDerivative

rename grid AR to cost

make sure that a node xyz and params are consistant after split/collapse

make sure that new split configureation has faces to trigger validuty check

clean up projections for adpat drivers

--Edge Based

parallelize the edge queue

--Parallel adapt

corsening on partition boundaries 
continue speed testing

-MesherX

improved normal visiblity on symm planes.
check for potential collisions of blend normals with surrounding area
check out frozen normal direction smoothing (VGrid style)
